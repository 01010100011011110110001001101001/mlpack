.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
The Gini gain, a measure of set purity usable as a fitness function (FitnessFunction) for decision trees\&. 

This is the exact same thing as the well-known Gini impurity, but negated---since the decision tree will be trying to maximize gain (and the Gini impurity would need to be minimized)\&.

\fIlabels\fP Set of labels to evaluate Gini impurity on\&.
