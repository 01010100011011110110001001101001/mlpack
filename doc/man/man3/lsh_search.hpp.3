Defines the LSHSearch class, which performs an approximate nearest neighbor search for a queries in a query set over a given dataset using Locality-sensitive hashing with 2-stable distributions\&.
.PP
The details of this method can be found in the following paper:

{datar2004locality, title={Locality-sensitive hashing scheme based on p-stable distributions}, author={Datar, M\&. and Immorlica, N\&. and Indyk, P\&. and Mirrokni, V\&.S\&.}, booktitle= {Proceedings of the 12th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry}, pages={253--262}, year={2004}, organization={ACM} }
.PP
Additionally, the class implements Multiprobe LSH, which improves approximation results during the search for approximate nearest neighbors\&. The Multiprobe LSH algorithm was presented in the paper:
