.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Given a covariance matrix, force the matrix to be positive definite\&. 

Also force a minimum value on the diagonal, so that even if the matrix is invertible, it doesn't cause problems with Cholesky decompositions\&. The forcing here is also done in order to bring the condition number of the matrix under 1e5 (10k), which should help with numerical stability\&.
