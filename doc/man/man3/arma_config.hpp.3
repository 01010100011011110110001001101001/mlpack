If you modify anything in here by hand, your warranty is void, your house may catch fire, and we're not going to call the police when your program segfaults so hard that robbers come to your house and take everything you own\&. If you do decide, against better judgment, to modify anything at all in this file, and you are reporting a bug, be absolutely certain to mention that you've done something stupid in this file first\&.
