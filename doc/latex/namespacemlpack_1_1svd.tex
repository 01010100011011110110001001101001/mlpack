\item 
class {\bf Q\+U\+I\+C\+\_\+\+S\+VD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Q\+U\+I\+C-\/\+S\+VD is a matrix factorization technique, which operates in a subspace such that A\textquotesingle{}s approximation in that subspace has minimum error(A being the data matrix). \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf Randomized\+S\+VD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Randomized S\+VD is a matrix factorization that is based on randomized matrix approximation techniques, developed in in \char`\"{}\+Finding structure with randomness\+:
\+Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions\char`\"{}. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf Regularized\+S\+VD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Regularized S\+VD is a matrix factorization technique that seeks to reduce the error on the training set, that is on the examples for which the ratings have been provided by the users. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bf Regularized\+S\+V\+D\+Function}
